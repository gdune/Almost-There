# Almost-There

High-fidelity prototype for CMSC434 Spring 2018.

To run:

1. Dowload Ionic onto your computer (see this link for details: https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/)

2. Clone this repository

3. cd into the repository that you just cloned

4. Run the following command: "ionic serve"

5. The app should pop up in your browser at "http://localhost:8100"

6. To see the app in a mobile format (which we recommend), change the URL to "http://localhost:8100/ionic-lab"
